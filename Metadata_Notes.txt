Summary:
Use this tool to add all of the attribute fields required for the priority calculation and MCDA-based weighting of the factors.

The tool requires only one input, namely the polygon feature class containing the Defined Hazardous Areas that will be analysed.This feature class should only contain the feature geometry and a single field that will be used for referencing back to the source system. This will both improve the performance of the analyses in subsequent steps and prevent unauthorised dissemination of sensitive data.

The tool will generate an output message after each field has been added to the feature class. Once the process has completed, the tool will display a message to confirm this.


Usage:
This tool forms part of a toolset designed to be used as an aid to optimizing the land clearance processes, and as such should not be used as the sole decisionmaking tool to identify land clearance priorities. The output generated by this tool and the toolset must be interpreted by competent specialist staff before it is used for any planning or other functions. The tools in this toolset provide no guarantees in terms of the accuracy or validity of the results generated, as the accuracy, validity and fitness of purpose of the input data cannot be determined by the tools. 
You are using these tools at your own risk and take full responsibility for the output generated by the tools and the toolset overall.

This tool may not be used or distributed in any form without written permission from the author, Arie Claassens. Its only purpose is to provide guidance in the prioritisation of land clearance activities.
