Summary:
Use this tool to add all of the attribute fields required for the priority calculation and MCDA-based weighting of the factors.

The tool requires only one input, namely the polygon feature class containing the Defined Hazardous Areas that will be analysed.This feature class should only contain the feature geometry and a single field that will be used for referencing back to the source system. This will both improve the performance of the analyses in subsequent steps and prevent unauthorised dissemination of sensitive data.

The tool will generate an output message after each field has been added to the feature class. Once the process has completed, the tool will display a message to confirm this.


Usage:
This tool forms part of a toolset designed to be used as an aid to optimizing the land clearance processes, and as such should not be used as the sole decisionmaking tool to identify land clearance priorities. The output generated by this tool and the toolset must be interpreted by competent specialist staff before it is used for any planning or other functions. The tools in this toolset provide no guarantees in terms of the accuracy or validity of the results generated, as the accuracy, validity and fitness of purpose of the input data cannot be determined by the tools.
You are using these tools at your own risk and take full responsibility for the output generated by the tools and the toolset overall.

Summary (Abstract):

Use this tool to add all of the attribute fields required for the priority calculation and MCDA-based weighting of the factors.

The tool requires only one input, namely the polygon feature class containing the Defined Hazardous Areas that will be analysed.This feature class should only contain the feature geometry and a single field that will be used for referencing back to the source system. This will both improve the performance of the analyses in subsequent steps and prevent unauthorised dissemination of sensitive data.

The tool will generate output messages during the course of the tool progress. Once the process has completed, the tool will display a message indicating the running time of the tool.The tool creates a datestamped log file in a directory of your choice, where the tool logs the process steps according to the logging verbosity level you select. The script also writes the log output to the script results window for immediate inspection.

Usage:

This tool forms part of a toolset designed to be used as an aid to optimizing the land clearance processes, and as such should not be used as the sole decisionmaking tool to identify land clearance priorities. The output generated by this tool and the toolset must be interpreted by competent specialist staff before it is used for any planning or other functions. The tools in this toolset provide no guarantees in terms of the accuracy or validity of the results generated, as the accuracy, validity and fitness of purpose of the input data cannot be determined by the tools.

You are using these tools at your own risk and take full responsibility for the output generated by the tools and the toolset overall.

========================================================================
Logging_Verbosity:

Debug
Info
Warning
Error
Critical


The Logging Verbosity variable determines the log verbosity level, with the DEBUG log level as the most verbose and the CRITICAL log level as the least verbose. This variable matches one of the predefined Python standard logging levels.

The higher the verbosity level of the log, the slower the script will progress through the steps, but you will have more information to use for debugging or inspection of the tool's output.

========================================================================
Log_Directory:

C:\TEMP

The Log Directory variable is used to determine where the datestamped log files must be generated. A default value of "C:\Temp" is supplied. If the directory does not exist on your workstation, you may create it so that the toolbox may store its log files here, or you may specify an existing directory to use for the log file storage. It is recommended that you use a local, fast drive for the log file storage in order to minimise the delay imposed by the writing of the log entries to the log file.

========================================================================
Source Feature Class:

This is the polygon feature class that will be extended with the attribute fields required for the priority classification and MCDA steps.
This is the hazard polygon feature class that will be updated with the value calculated for the land cover attribute, which was added as new field in the first step.

========================================================================
Compare Projections:

This option allows you to compare the spatial references between the Hazard Area feature class and the Land Cover raster layer. If the spatial references mismatch, the script is halted. You will need to reproject the land cover raster to match the Hazard Area feature class spatial reference before you can re-run this tool. If you bypass the comparison of the projection used by the two data sets, you run the risk of distorting the outcome of the tool and the final results of the MCDA tool.

========================================================================
Update Only:

This option allows you to restrict the script to only update existing values and leave new records, who will have a NULL value for their land cover attribute, untouched.
